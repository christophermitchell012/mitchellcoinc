# MitchellCo Interactive Data Maps

Interactive, standalone public-data maps for weather, wildfire, earthquakes, drought, floods, geology, infrastructure, environment, public risk, space weather, marine conditions, astronomy context, and current events.

## Repository architecture

Numbered maps live at the repository root as `NN-map-name.html`. Saved snapshots and reusable reference data live under `data/`. Topic identity SVGs live under `assets/icons/` and are linked as resources rather than embedded in HTML.

Publication is intentionally simple: prepare the complete map/data/index/sitemap/docs state, run `python3 scripts/check_publication.py`, commit the coherent tree, then let the read-only publication Action validate it and GitHub Pages deploy the exact committed tree. Actions do not generate, commit, or push repository content.

Static, slow-changing, rate-limited, or browser-incompatible source data should be acquired and normalized at build time. Runtime cross-origin requests are reserved for authoritative anonymous/keyless browser-CORS sources with safe client fan-out.

## Current roadmap

Next candidates:
- 31 Lightning Activity & Wildfire Ignition Potential
- 32 Tornado Climatology & Current Severe Weather Context
- 33 Hail Exposure & Crop/Property Risk
- 34 High Wind & Infrastructure Exposure

Global Landslide Hazard & Rainfall Trigger Watch is at the bottom of the unnumbered backlog until a stable anonymous/keyless NASA LHASA path passes the source gate. Global Aviation Weather remains deferred. BloomWatch remains deferred until observation-record licensing/redistribution is clearly compatible with commercial/public reuse.

## Recent source contracts

- **Map 21:** U.S. National Ice Center IMS daily chart images, displayed directly; no snow-depth or ice-thickness claim.
- **Map 24:** Macrostrat surface geology plus EarthByte/GPlates reconstruction context.
- **Map 25:** USGS NLDI connected-flowline navigation with bounded distance.
- **Map 26:** NASA VIIRS Black Marble reference radiance, NOAA/NWS cloud forecast, and derived Sun/Moon context. Its build tooling may use the user-authorized `EARTHDATA_TOKEN`; the token is never published.
- **Map 27:** NOAA/BGS WMM2025 coefficients and official test vectors loaded same-origin.
- **Map 28:** Client-side solar geometry with no runtime weather claims.
- **Map 29:** USGS Water Data OGC `latest-continuous`, parameter 72019, loaded only on explicit user action; raw groundwater depth is not converted into a drought score.
- **Map 30:** USACE CRREL Ice Jam Database. The map uses a dated same-origin factual subset of the anonymous Water Year 2026 report. It is not a forecast, live closure feed, or exhaustive copy. See `data/map30-source-license.md`.
- **Map 31:** NOAA SPC `1950-2025_actual_tornadoes.csv`, stored as a dated same-origin snapshot (`scripts/map31_build_snapshot.py` rebuilds it). Historical counts are 1-degree start-point counts with no forecast or risk score. A live layer requests active NWS tornado alerts from `api.weather.gov` in the visitor's browser and degrades to a status message if it fails. See `data/map31-source-license.md`.

## Site/search files

`index.html` is the crawlable collection directory. `sitemap.xml` lists the index and every numbered map. `robots.txt` points to the sitemap. `_config.yml` defines the `/maps` base URL. `scripts/check_publication.py` is the read-only integrity checker and `scripts/build_sitemap.py` deterministically builds the sitemap.

## Design goals

- Browser-first standalone HTML where practical
- Authoritative or explicitly approved public sources
- Same-origin snapshots for static/slow/rate-limited data
- No credentials in public runtime code
- Zero prohibited proprietary GIS platform dependencies
- Clear attribution and source semantics
- GA4 `G-8SVEH8WD1R`
- GitHub Pages friendly and crawlable
